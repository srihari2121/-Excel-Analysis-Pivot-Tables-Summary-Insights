 Sales Performance Analysis (Kaggle Dataset)

 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales performance using popular Kaggle datasets such as  Amazon Sales.  
The goal of this analysis is to clean raw data, build interactive pivot tables, and create a simple dashboard in Microsoft Excel to extract meaningful business insights.

The project demonstrates core Data Analyst skills including data cleaning, pivot table analysis, visualization, and analytical storytelling.

Dataset Information
- Source: Kaggle
- Dataset Examples:
  - Superstore Sales Dataset
  - E-Commerce Dataset
  - Amazon Sales Dataset
- File Format: Excel (.xlsx)
- Records: Thousands of sales transactions
- Key Columns:
  - Order Date
  - Category
  - Region
  - Segment
  - Sales
  - Profit

 Data Cleaning Process
Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy:
- Removed blank and duplicate records
- Fixed incorrect date formats
- Standardized category, region, and segment names
- Trimmed extra spaces and corrected text inconsistencies
- Converted the dataset into an Excel Table for auto-updating pivot tables


 Analysis & Pivot Tables
The following pivot tables were created:

 Total Sales by Category
- Identifies top-performing product categories
- Categories sorted from highest to lowest sales

 Sales by Region and Segment
- Compares regional performance across customer segments
- Conditional formatting used to highlight high-performing regions

 Profit Margin Analysis
- Created a calculated column:  
  Profit Margin = Profit / Sales
- Analyzed average profit margin by category and region

 Interactive Dashboard Features
- Slicers added for:
  - Region
  - Category
  - Segment
- All pivot tables connected to slicers for interactive filtering
- Dashboard layout designed to simulate BI tools like Power BI or Tableau


 Data Visualizations
- Pivot charts created to visualize:
  - Sales distribution by category
  - Regional sales performance
- Used clean and simple charts for easy business interpretation

 Key Insights
- Technology category contributes the highest share of total sales
- West region consistently outperforms other regions across segments
- Office Supplies show relatively higher profit margins despite lower sales
- Furniture category has strong sales but lower profitability, indicating cost or pricing challenges
